# Kmeans-and-Kmedoids
Suppose that the data mining task is to cluster the following eight points (with (x,y) representing location) into three clusters.

A1(2,10),A2(2,5),A3(8,4),B1(5,8),B2(7,5),B3(6,4),C1(1,2),C2(4,9).

The distance function is Euclidean distance. Suppose initially we assign A1, B1, and C1 as the center of each cluster, respectively. Use the k-means algorithm to write a computer program to show the ﬁnal three clusters. (To get > 90 mark, also use k-medoids algorithm to program to show the result.)
